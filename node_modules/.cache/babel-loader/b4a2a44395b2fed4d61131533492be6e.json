The Bay Area daily local newsletter, which is reminiscent of a daily local paper, includes tops stories across local news, sports, politics, dining and more. The stories are compiled from numerous publications, including the San Francisco Chronicle, SF Gate, Eater San Francisco, KQED, The Oaklandside and others.</p>\\n<p>All of the stories included in the newsletter are curated by Apple News editors, as opposed to being selected by algorithms &#8212; a decision that should cut down on the recirculation of clickbait and other low-value content. Apple News considers the Bay Area newsletter to be a local’s end-of-day digest that includes notable news and other information about what&#8217;s happening around them. The daily local newsletter joins Apple News&#8217; daily newsletter that delivers national news to larger audiences.</p>\\n<p>The launch arrives at a time when a number of tech companies are adding newsletters as part of their offerings, including Twitter with its <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/\\\">acquisition of Revue</a> and <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/\\\">Facebook&#8217;s newsletter platform Bulletin</a>, for example. Top newsletter platform Substack was <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/\\\">also valued at $650 million</a> as of its Series B, indicating the sizable market for this more old-school form news media, that&#8217;s at least partially arisen due to the <a href=\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-19/why-local-newspaper-websites-are-so-terrible?sref=gni836kR\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">declining usability</a> of newspapers&#8217; websites.</p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2265236\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>If Apple chooses to roll out more daily local newsletters, it will have several markets to choose from. Today, Apple News offers local news coverage in 11 markets, including San Francisco, the Bay Area, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, Miami, Charlotte, San Antonio and Washington, D.C. Apple says it plans to launch its local news feature in more cities in the future.</p>\\n<p>The tech giant&#8217;s local news offerings indicate that it&#8217;s looking to further compete with other news aggregator services such as <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/flipboard-expands-into-local-news/\\\">Flipboard</a> and <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/smartnews-local-news-feature-now-covers-more-than-6000-u-s-cities/\\\">SmartNews</a>, which offer local news coverage in thousands of U.S. cities.</p>\\n\",\n          \"protected\": false\n        },\n        \"excerpt\": {\n          \"rendered\": \"<p>Apple News is introducing its first daily local newsletter for the Bay Area and is actively exploring expanding the offering to other cities.

Fintech tailwinds, strengthened by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, only accelerated in 2021. And despite public markets’ rocky start in early January, we’re confident that 2022 will be another banner year for the sector.</p>\\n<p>In this year’s edition of the Matrix Fintech Index, we’ll look at the performance of public fintech versus the broader market in 2021 and reflect on the private fintech market’s red-hot year. Then, we’ll turn our attention to the year ahead and offer some predictions for fintech in 2022.</p>\\n<h2>Fintech continued to outperform the market by 3x</h2>\\n<p>The Matrix Fintech Index has significantly outperformed major public stock indexes as well as a basket of legacy financial service providers for the fifth year in a row. As a reminder, the Matrix Fintech Index is a market-cap weighted index that tracks a portfolio of 25 leading public fintech companies.</p>\\n<p>Despite a roughly 30% draw-down in the last months of 2021, the Matrix Fintech Index continued to beat the broader market as well as incumbent financial service companies. Fintech’s consistent outperformance signals that the changes brought about by COVID-19 – including shifts toward e-commerce, online payments and digital interactions over physical ones – are here to stay.</p>\\n<p>\\t<div class=\\\"article-block block--pullout block--right\\\">\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 2022 opened with shaky markets and signs of multiple compression, but we believe this year will set another record with at least $300 billion in fintech liquidity.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t</p>\\n<h2>A great year of public debuts</h2>\\n<p>Last year was outstanding for fintech IPOs, with notable debuts occurring across several categories. Consumer companies such as Coinbase ($86 billion) and Robinhood ($32 billion), infrastructure players such as dLocal ($6 billion) and Marqeta ($15 billion), and insurtech providers such as Lemonade ($1.6 billion) all entered the public market.</p>\\n<p>There was also increased diversity in the way these companies went public, with some fintechs skipping the traditional IPO process altogether. More companies, such as Coinbase in the U.S. or Wise in the U.K., chose direct listings, while Robinhood earmarked $700 million in shares for its existing customers.</p>\\n<p>Others, including Hippo, Metromile and SoFi, chose to go public via SPAC. While SPACs&#8217; track records have been mixed, even accounting for recent market volatility, the rise of IPO alternatives is a welcome change for the growing ranks of late-stage fintech unicorns.</p>\\n<h2>A record year with 151 new unicorns</h2>\\n<p>Private markets followed public markets in making 2021 a record-setting year. VC funding into private fintech companies crossed $134 billion in 2021, rising by 177% from a year earlier, according to <a

Crypto investments are <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/01/despite-bumps-crypto-investment-starts-2022-with-a-roar/\\\">already seeing a good start to 2022 building off record hype in 2021</a>.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When asked to confirm the crypto focus, Ohanian told TechCrunch that 776 follows “the lead of the smartest founders we meet.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So if they keep building in Web3, we’ll keep funding them,” Ohanian said. “We’re also seeing a strong push into climate tech, space tech, food tech and still good old-fashioned SaaS businesses.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As for how 776 sources its deals, the investor said that for now, it’s a “really old-fashioned” process in which leads mostly come via email or text and then end up in Cerebro, the operating system his firm developed.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">That will improve this year with some more product to widen our top-of-funnel,” Ohanian said.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Cerebro is its first product and is designed to give founders a way to search 776’s network of 44,000 contracts and request an introduction “with one click.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The thinking behind the technology was simple. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“We have a great network that returns our emails and it’s not a good task for a human brain to be asked ‘hey do you know someone at twitter? Do you know a machine learning engineer?’” said Ohanian. “It’s much better to query a database anytime you want to.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">All of 776’s work lives there and that too is by design, he said. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“This creates transparency and accountability – not only within our team, but also with our founders and investors,” Ohanian told TechCrunch. “The goal is to scale the most valuable and most productizable parts of our work first, so that when we spend time with our founders it’s the kind of work only humans can do well (empathy, strategy, creativity).”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When launching 776’s first fund, the firm said explicitly that it </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">sought a diverse investor base, of which 50% identified as female and 15% as Black or Indigenous people. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So how’s it doing?</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The firm invites all its LPs to participate in a biannual, </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">in-depth demographic survey.

footing again. Today, it announced that over the last fiscal year, annual recurring revenue (ARR) has jumped 4x to over $50 million.</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s quite a comeback for a company that faced great turmoil starting in 2019, when then-CEO Steve Singh <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/steve-singh-stepping-down-as-docker-ceo/\\\">stepped down</a> and was replaced briefly by Rob Bearden. Shortly thereafter, it <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/\\\">sold its enterprise business</a>, its primary source of revenue, before eventually promoting longtime exec Scott Johnston to CEO.</p>\\n<p>At that time, it also<a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/after-selling-enterprise-biz-docker-lands-35m-investment-and-new-ceo/\\\"> took on new funding</a> going back almost to square one, actually taking on the investment as a Series A company. It simultaneously implemented a new developer-centered strategy while dropping from 400 employees down to just 60. A few months later, the first wave of the pandemic hit. It was not an easy time, according to Johnston, who had to steer the company through this instability.</p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2265183\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>&#8220;November 2019 was a time [fraught] with risk and uncertainty but we believed in the tailwinds of the market, we believed in the developers&#8217; love of our product, and that we could come together as a team, focus on the developer, deliver great products and build a legitimate business,&#8221; Johnston told me.</p>\\n<p>Docker had a couple of things going for it, even with that uncertainty. It had widespread brand recognition among developers and was synonymous with containerization, a way to package and deliver software as individual services in the cloud, rather than one monolithic application.</p>\\n<p>It also has a bunch of open source pieces that can act as the top of the funnel for eventual sales activity, with the goal of turning some of the users of the free products into paying customers. That appears to have happened with increasing frequency over the last year, judging from the company&#8217;s ARR growth over that period.</p>\\n<p>The goal in the early days of the restructuring was to capture that developer momentum around the brand and deliver them the free open source products, then expand into the paid products over time for a certain percentage of them. This was a very different approach from what they took when they were selling Docker Enterprise and were generally selling to IT, rather than developers or their managers.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"wby472V2cQ\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company/\\\">Docker regroups as cloud-native developer tool company</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;Docker regroups as cloud-native developer tool company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company/embed/#?secret=q5CHDSDsF5#?secret=wby472V2cQ\\\" data-secret=\\\"wby472V2cQ\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n<p>That product-led growth approach worked from a commercial perspective when the managers began buying related commercial tools. &#8220;So when the developer has a great experience using the free product, and as they and their organizations scale their use of the products, then there&#8217;s features that managers value that they are willing to pay for.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>He added, &#8220;What you&#8217;re seeing with the financial performance that we described <a href=\\\"https://www.docker.com/blog/celebrating-our-second-fiscal-year/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">in our blog post</a> that&#8217;s driven purely from those large organizations that realize these productivity benefits … and are willing to pay for the management security tools to enable organization-wide adoption.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Docker was founded in 2013 before restructuring in 2019. At the time it sold its enterprise business to Mirantis, the company took on <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/after-selling-enterprise-biz-docker-lands-35m-investment-and-new-ceo/\\\">a $35 million Series A</a> investment from Benchmark Capital and Insight Partners.

The goal behind the $13 million capital pool was to invest in Black founders. The WYL round indicates that the fund is living up to its plan.</p>\\n<p>TechCrunch spoke with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/chief_ofo\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Ofo Ezeugwu</a>, founder and CEO of WYL, about his company and its new investment. Per Ezeugwu, WYL was founded back in 2015 and raised $1.1 million over a roughly seven-year period. Launched with a focus on collecting renter notes concerning landlord and building quality, the company has evolved to include a SaaS service for what WYL calls &#8220;home providers,&#8221; or the folks who own buildings and other rental units.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265160\\\" style=\\\"width: 210px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265160\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"vertical wp-image-2265160 size-medium\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?w=200\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg 3648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gfs-nyc-ofo-ezeugwu-final1.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\\\" /><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265160\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WYL.

For rental owners with a good number of units, they can pay for the collected information, allowing landlords to track how they are performing with their customers, how many of their current tenants intend to stay, and so forth.</p>\\n<p>The startup charges building owners $2 per unit, per month for its software, a figure that Ezeugwu said can be discounted for larger contract volumes. The startup has plans to expand its feature set, naturally, allowing it to charge more in time. An example the CEO provided during our chat was using natural language processing (NLP) to find trends in written reviews, which could help companies with hundreds of units better parse incoming feedback.</p>\\n<p>Before it launched its software product, WYL generated revenue through brand partnerships with companies like Allstate and others that sell to folks who rent. Presumably, the company can continue that work to supplement its software incomes, though we anticipate that WYL will become a majority software business in time &#8212; if it isn&#8217;t already &#8212; from a revenue perspective.</p>\\n<p>The idea of underestimated founders is bandied about in startup land pretty often. And yet if we rifled through the latest few hundred funding rounds, you might wind up wondering if anything has changed at all.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p>Black Ops co-founder <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/motownini\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">James Norman</a> told TechCrunch about his own fundraising journey for his company, <a href=\\\"https://www.pilot.ly/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Pilot.ly</a>, when explaining the impetus behind his venture group. In Norman&#8217;s view, Black founders are underinvested in, which means that his firm may have access to deal flow that competing venture firms are overlooking and that the founders he wanted to invest in are &#8220;the biggest arbitrage opportunity to tech.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Now flush with its largest investment to date and a software product in-market &#8212; after running pilots for the SaaS offering last year, WYL has onboarded 7,000 units, the CEO said &#8212; the startup intends to hire and keep building. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale its software incomes. If that goes according to plan, it shouldn&#8217;t have to wait another seven years for external investor interest to manifest in the form of a seven-figure check.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><em>The startup

Instead of having one person share their findings with the company, rope as many stakeholders into the process as possible.</p>\\n<p>I managed customer listening sessions at one startup that were so fruitful, our product managers, designers and engineers started attending.

id=\\\"speakable-summary\\\">Rising pressure on big business to address the threat of climate change by decarbonizing their ops has, in recent years, led to huge demand for carbon offset schemes &#8212; enabling companies to buy carbon credits to &#8216;offset&#8217; emissions so they can claim to be &#8216;greening&#8217; their activities, without having to make more substantial changes (like, say, an airline running fewer planes).</p>\\n<p>Unsurprisingly this has created lots of wonky incentives attached to forestry resources and carbon offsetting projects. Which, in turn, is creating lots of knock-on startup opportunities.</p>\\n<p>One example of dubious carbon offsetting involves existing woodlands being repurposed for carbon credits in a way that <a href=\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-17/the-real-trees-delivering-fake-climate-progress-for-corporate-america\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">artificially inflates the claimed credit</a> &#8212; such as by claiming a forest was going to be cut down when it wasn&#8217;t, meaning there is no net increase in carbon sequestered (and a woodland is essentially just repurposed to help corporates greenwash their pollutive &#8216;business as usual&#8217;). So without robust oversight carbon offsetting projects can clearly be a sink for kicking the climate can down the road towards disaster.</p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2264900\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>Similarly, greenwashing pressures have led to the awful sight of trees being chopped up for biomass and burnt &#8212; under a <a href=\\\"https://physicsworld.com/a/biomass-energy-green-or-dirty/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">dubious claim of &#8216;green energy&#8217;</a>. Here, too, there&#8217;s a need for rigorous accountancy &#8212; in the form of a full lifecycle analysis of a biomass project &#8212; else the risks can even go beyond meaningless greenwashing to actively harmful environmental outcomes (such as a loss of mature woodlands and another net reduction in how much carbon is sequestered).</p>\\n<p>Pressure on companies to quickly get on a path to carbon neutrality is, very evidently, generating huge but often poorly directed demand to stand up glossy marketing pledges that claim to be &#8216;tackling&#8217; climate change.</p>\\n<p>The overarching question is whether anything of value is being done with this corporate reputation spend when it comes to actually preventing catastrophic climate change?</p>\\n<p>Turns out this too is a burgeoning startup business opportunity.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p>Startups applying technologies to target the accountability/credibility gap around carbon offsetting by proposing schemes to verify the credibility of projects and monitor performance include the likes of <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/as-concerns-rise-over-forest-carbon-offsets-pachamas-verified-offset-marketplace-gets-15-million/\\\">Pachama</a> and <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/sylvera-series-a/\\\">Sylvera</a>, which are both backed by some major investors &#8212; with around $25M and $39M raised respectively to date.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"0a51Fc3y0Z\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/sylvera-series-a/\\\">Sylvera takes $32M to build trust in carbon offsetting ratings</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;Sylvera takes $32M to build trust in carbon offsetting ratings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/sylvera-series-a/embed/#?secret=9yK8iISXFj#?secret=0a51Fc3y0Z\\\" data-secret=\\\"0a51Fc3y0Z\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n<p>There are also startups focused on expanding access to carbon markets so that smaller landowners can get looped into revenue-generating carbon offsets for their woodlands. Such as US-focused <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/silviaterra-wants-to-bring-the-benefits-of-carbon-offsets-to-every-landowner-everywhere/\\\">Silvia Terra</a>.</p>\\n<p>The prospect of receiving recurring revenue for conserving forestry may at least held protect woodlands from other forms of development that could see trees felled to make way for different money-generating schemes with less or no carbon sequestering benefits. But &#8212; clearly &#8212; forestry conservation alone isn&#8217;t going to be enough to reduce global carbon emissions.</p>\\n<p>Hence other climate startups are focused on expanding the volume of forested landmass. Such as <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/terraformation-gets-30m-to-fight-climate-change-with-rapid-reforesting/\\\">Terraformation</a> &#8212; which is using a mix of old and new technologies to rapidly reforest wasteland with the goal of increasing the amount of global landmass that&#8217;s covered by trees.</p>\\n<p>Again, though, even tree planting has been <a href=\\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/tree-planting-wont-stop-climate-crisis-1020500/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">criticized as a flawed &#8220;magical thinking&#8221; non-solution to climate change</a>.</p>\\n<p>In some cases, poor incentives to simply increase forestry volume have led to native tree species being ripped out and replaced with faster growing alternatives &#8212; leading to biodiversity loss and a forestry monoculture that&#8217;s less resilient to the challenges of a changing climate. Which is also, ultimately, environmentally counterproductive.</p>\\n<p>Climate change increases the risk of drought, storms and forest fire &#8212; all of which can decimate forests. So mindless tree planting projects that fail to effectively model risks, don&#8217;t selectively and sensitivity plant, and fail to follow through with good forestry management to ensure the long term success of a woodland are also best filed under pointless (and even potentially harmful) greenwashing.</p>\\n<p>The sad truth is that, globally, forests are still being felled at a far faster rate than they&#8217;re being replanted &#8212; and ultimately that net destruction is fuelled by the unreconstructed demands of industry and the system of growth-focused consumption that powers the modern world.</p>\\n<p>Without systemic restructuring of how we consume and trade towards a reformed, circular economy that revolves around reuse and longevity it&#8217;s hard to see how the rapacious global engine of demand can be dialled back to an environmentally sustainable level &#8212; in which trees and all the rest of life on Earth (including humans) can survive and thrive far into the future.</p>\\n<p>Given such vast challenges &#8212; not to mention the incremental timescales involve in anything attached to forestry ecosystems &#8212; startups that are trying to make a meaningful difference in this space certainly have their work cut out.</p>\\n<h2>Optimizing for forest survival</h2>\\n<p>YC-backed <a href=\\\"https://pina.earth/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Pina Earth</a> is a relative newcomer (founded 2021) that&#8217;s trying to tackle some of the problematic incentives around carbon offsetting projects by creating smarter skews that encourage landowners to increase woodland biodiversity and future-proof forests against the hotter, harsher climate that&#8217;s fast coming at us.</p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s doing this by pitching forest owners on making sustainable improvements to existing woodlands that will enable them to get certification for additional carbon credits &#8212; i.e. on top of whatever their woodland may already be bringing in &#8212; generating a &#8220;recurring income&#8221; via selling any extra stored carbon to the scores of companies eager to top up their offsetting.</p>\\n<p>So while some carbon offsetting atop existing woodlands may be accused of bogus greenwashing, here at least the premise is that carbon credits are being attached to &#8212; and contingent on &#8212; <em>improvements</em> to forestry that will, or well, <em>should</em> generate extra carbon, assuming all goes to plan.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;With the help of sustainable forestry, your forest can store additional carbon,&#8221; runs the pitch to forest owners on Pina Earth&#8217;s <a href=\\\"https://pina.earth/en/waldbesitzer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">website</a>. &#8220;This is done through measures such as planting climate-resilient tree species and increasing biodiversity.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The Munch-based startup &#8212;

L to R: Fincke, Biermann, Kerber. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pina Earth</p></div></p>\\n<p>Their idea is to sell landowners on the financial value of good woodland management &#8212; linking sustainable forestry to additional carbon credits which mean there&#8217;s a financial reward for making the kinds of relatively costly interventions that are likely to be needed to make woodlands more productive (in carbon sequestering terms) and resilient to climate change over the longer term.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Essentially we&#8217;re building an online platform where we&#8217;re connecting forest owners and carbon credit buyers,&#8221; explains Biermann. &#8220;Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for forest owners to be rewarded for the ecosystem services they provide.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In the projects that we do we&#8217;re trying to change the species diversity of the forest over time to make it more resilient to climate change,&#8221; she adds.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s really our goal &#8212; to democratize access to this market, to the voluntary carbon market in this case, where I think for one of the first times you&#8217;re able to align ecology and economy in a very productive way,&#8221; she also tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The way that it works in the forest timeline is you actually give out future-looking carbon credits &#8212; this is quite common in the forestry carbon credit scene because they&#8217;re just slow ecosystems. So you&#8217;re trying to overcome this by paying someone now for the carbon that will be sequestered a bit later on.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;With the monitoring cycle that we have of about three years this is something that we would then align to these vintages of carbon credits being given out in three year cycles to keep incentivizing the forest owners to keep doing the restructuring project over time.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Albeit she won&#8217;t be drawn into predicting exactly how much extra income a landowner might be able to generate through additional carbon credits. (She says the price will &#8220;depend&#8221; on a variety of per-project factors, such as the existing tree species and how much optimization is possible.)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the challenge we&#8217;re trying to address the whole way through is incentivizing someone to do something now that will pay off in let&#8217;s say 30 or 40 years because forests are just very slow ecosystems,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;As a startup I think that&#8217;s quite an interesting challenge because us starting into this journey &#8212; the effects of this will take place a lot later, so once we are kind of close to the end of our work life, so I think that&#8217;s a very interesting perspective on the timeframe, also as a startup founder.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To support its long term environmental mission, Pina Earth is building a platform that helps landowners with the admin side of project certification, especially to make it easier for smaller landowners to access carbon markers &#8212; while also taking care of the remote sensing and AI modelling to quantify a project&#8217;s carbon outputs and &#8212; it hopes &#8212; increase the speed and quality of carbon credits derived from the forestry.</p>\\n<p>There are a couple of components to Pina Earth&#8217;s product (which is still pre-commercial launch).</p>\\n<p>Firstly process automation: It&#8217;s building out a platform to support landowners through what can be a complex certification process vs manually filling in scores of forms.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265060\\\" style=\\\"width: 690px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265060\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-large wp-image-2265060\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?w=680\\\" alt=\\\"Pina Earth - Dashboard\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"619\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=150,137 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=300,273 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=768,699 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=680,619 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=1536,1398 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=2048,1864 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=50,46 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\\\" /><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265060\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Pina Earth project dashboard. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Pina Earth</p></div></p>\\n<p>The second, back-end element involves complex data processing and modelling, such as using machine learning to predict how climate change might affect future growth of the forest and impact its ability to sequester carbon.</p>\\n<p>To power this and conduct ongoing <span style=\\\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">remote monitoring of the projects Pina Earth is pulling in and processing 2D and 3D data on forests, captured via sensors attached to ultralight aircraft (it partners with a third party to do the actual data gathering). </span></p>\\n<p>She says they considered a range of possible methods for remotely capturing data to monitor the carbon offsetting projects &#8212; from drones to satellites &#8212; but settled on hobby planes as best suited to capture the level of data needed for it to be able to quantify improvements to forests.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the middle with this approach of using ultralight aircraft data because the type of project that we&#8217;re focusing on &#8212; improved forest management &#8212; actually requires an improved resolution [vs satellite data] to be able to detect the tree species,&#8221; she notes.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our goal &#8212; with these improved forest management projects &#8212; is we try to summate into the future what will happen to this particular forest under climate change. Because especially in Germany &#8212; but also throughout Europe &#8212; we&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of forests dying due to droughts, bark beetles, storms. And we&#8217;re trying to incentivize forest owners to change the structure of these forests that are mostly monocultures &#8212; usually one type of tree species &#8212; to a biodiverse mix.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Biermann likens the approach to diversifying a financial portfolio &#8212; i.e. in order to make it &#8220;less prone to risk in the future&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>As well as increasing the mix of of trees in a woodland as a strategy to reduce disease risk, she mentions that having forestry where growth is managed so as not to have all the trees at the same height can help with resilience to storms, for example.</p>\\n<p>She suggests it may also be the case that landowners need to plant different, even non-local tree species that may be more resistant to the hotter temperatures and drought conditions which are associated with climate change.</p>\\n<p>Per Biermann, Pina Earth is planning to do monitoring of projects about every three years &#8212; &#8220;to have a tighter net on what&#8217;s going on on the ground in this forest; is it developing in the way we&#8217;d like it to?&#8221;, as she puts it.</p>\\n<p>Doing remote monitoring of forests allows for more regular monitoring vs traditional on the ground methods, which &#8212; she suggests &#8212; helps improve the quality of the carbon credit. She says its method is able to transform the 2D and 3D forestry data it gets as a raw input into &#8220;single tree-based carbon storage&#8221; validation of projects.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think what&#8217;s also unique in our approach is that we simulate carbon sequestration of every single tree that we detected into the future under changing regional climate conditions,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;This allows us to optimize for this forest&#8217;s survival probability and sequester more carbon. So I think there&#8217;s where we have a unique twist to forest carbon projects because we&#8217;re very much focused on making those forests climate resilient.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>While the startup&#8217;s initial business model is focused on charging forest owners for its SaaS, Biermann says ultimately they want to be able to offer the tech for free to maximize access &#8212; but would then charge a cut on any extra carbon credits generated.</p>\\n<p>However that could create a potential conflict of interest &#8212; since Pina Earth is also involved in assessing the quality and performance of the projects.</p>\\n<p>Asked how it would resolve that conflict Biermann says it&#8217;s working with a German non-profit &#8212; which has a technical advisory board that spans environmental organizations, forestry science and the carbon credit market &#8212; and she envisages such an independent entity being involved in helping to verify the carbon credits as an additional accountability layer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re partnering with this local non-profit that&#8217;s developing a domestic German forest carbon standard,&#8221; she says, adding.  &#8220;Since they are also just developing this we&#8217;re working very closely to get our data interactions points very aligned so that there won&#8217;t be the downside of having larger costs and having a longer process to get certified&#8230; In this case working with this non-profit that&#8217;s also doing the stakeholder consultation really gives this additional trust and allows us to not have this conflict of interest because there&#8217;s another party also looking at the project.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Discussing generally how it stands up the accuracy of its data, she says it&#8217;s using terrestrial forest data (which landowners usually already have) at the start of a project to benchmark the accuracy of its models when it&#8217;s using remote sensing.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This ground-truthing with terrestrial data&#8217;s really important to use to be able to show we can get close to these results,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;The other side of it, I think, is more related to having a stakeholder dialogue &#8212; to get everybody on board, all kinds of different organizations, because you have to agree on the way a forest carbon credit is actually generated, and for that we&#8217;re partnering with [local] organizations.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Biermann says Pina Earth is also intending to put its method through a public consultation process &#8212; and its website notes that its open data approach will include purchased carbon credits being &#8220;r<span style=\\\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">etired in a public registry&#8221; to ensure they can only be used once &#8212; &#8220;to make sure that we don&#8217;t have any blind spots&#8221;. </span></p>\\n<p>Given the rising numbers of carbon offsetting validation startups there are likely to be growing opportunities for other types of partnerships that may further help drive accountability.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s actually one of the most exciting things of working in this particular segment because at least from our experience everybody is so open to partnering because the bottom line is you&#8217;re trying to remove carbon from the atmosphere and you&#8217;re trying to create this sustainable impact so if we could achieve this by partnering I think everybody is kind of on board, so there&#8217;s usually not a long discussion on this,&#8221; adds Biermann. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more collaborative, I think, than other environments.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>What about if forest projects don&#8217;t perform as it projected when it handed out the carbon credit?</p>\\n<p>On that, Biermann says it&#8217;s built in multiple safeguards &#8212; starting with making conservative assumptions on the science side.</p>\\n<p>It is also structuring the credit system with a &#8220;risk buffer&#8221;, whereby a certain percentage of carbon credits are pooled across all projects, so aren&#8217;t given out, &#8220;as an internal insurance mechanism&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We are also doing this frequent monitoring cycle because we want to be able to incorporate new science as it comes out,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Thankfully this is a really active science scene and we are quite close to the scientific community un our startup so also with our measurements and monitoring we want to adjust to and adapt to whenever anything new is found out&#8230; to really guarantee this high quality carbon credit, also for the carbon credit buyer side.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>On the wider critique of carbon offsetting &#8212; i.e. that it generates greenwashing by creating a means for companies to pay to avoid making systemic changes that will lead to net reductions in their own carbon emissions &#8212; Biermann agrees this can be a problem.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Some carbon credits projects have been questioned on the way they set up their methodology and that&#8217;s why we went through all of the forest methodologies that are out there for domestic and international standards for voluntary carbon projects to rethink the criteria and to try to automate the documentation to, again, democratize access to these but also to really think about what does a high credit have to show? What&#8217;s important to do in terms of data?&#8221; she also says.</p>\\n<p>To try to avoid Pina Earth ending up inadvertently working for greenwashers, Biermann says it&#8217;s partnering with organizations that are doing carbon footprinting for corporates.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Partnering with them I think is important because then they&#8217;re the part who does the footprint calculation, according to official criteria. They first work on reduction methods and only then do they resort to offset projects. So I see ourselves very much in this chain &#8212; and the important of other partners who work on footprinting and reduction,&#8221; she suggests.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;There are so many startups working on different issues &#8212; let&#8217;s say of the carbon credit value chain &#8212; I can think of a lot of other problem areas where it would be great if other startups started; having a way to really tell the footprint of a company through the scope 1, 2, 3 [emissions]. Being able to make that transparent. Yeah, so a lot of transparency issues along the value chain are being tackled by different startups&#8230; And those are the ones we get to partner with, essentially.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>On the go to market front, Pina Earth is focused initially on its home turf and forests of Germany &#8212; where it is currently operating two projects across 1,200 hectares as it prepares to launch later this year.</p>\\n<p>But Biermann says it believes its approach can scale across Europe &#8212; and she <span style=\\\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">mentions France, Spain as other countries of &#8220;particular&#8221; interest, because they have quite similar forest structures to Germany so it reckons it could easily transfer its methods there. </span></p>\\n<p>The UK is another potential market it&#8217;s eyeing expanding into, she adds.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;An advantage with these countries is they already have domestic forest carbon standards &#8212; in the UK that would be the woodland carbon code for example,&#8221; she notes. &#8220;And we could then apply to get our methodology approved with them to develop these types of improved forest management projects under a domestic standard in a different country.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Sadly, a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2438-y\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">study</a> published in 2020 found that Europe&#8217;s forest biomass has seen a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/europe-losing-forest-to-harvesting-at-alarming-rate-data-suggests\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">dramatic rise in the rate of loss</a> since 2015 &#8212; likely as a result of increased demand for timber and to burn wood for biomass. So the trend curve is not bending in the right direction.</p>\\n<p>Albeit that means there&#8217;s even greater imperative to nudge regional landowners towards sustainable forestry and caring for &#8212; not cutting down &#8212; their precious woodlands.</p>\\n<p>What&#8217;s Biermann prediction for the future of forestry? Is every woodland going to be end up under some form of high tech surveillance and carbon quantification &#8212; with such tech becoming a key conservation tool, given the still rising pressures on natural ecosystems?</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It comes back to if you don&#8217;t really measure it you can&#8217;t really incentivize it and you can&#8217;t really value it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;At least in the way that our economy works. So I think it would be really beneficial for forests to be measured more closely and to then brought to the attention of the public and investors.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think we can see a shift towards this &#8212; I think it goes beyond climate investments being done for the climate&#8217;s sake but because it is the next wave of innovation and economic opportunity. So I think in that sense these monitoring systems will become more applicable to also other forest areas.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Currently Pina Earth is in YC&#8217;s Winter batch &#8212; so is focused on getting ready for demo day.</p>\\n<p>The $500k in funding it&#8217;s received via the accelerator is its first external investment, with the founders having bootstrapped early research and development of the product.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We had a couple of grants that helped us bootstrap along the way and this is the first equity funding now that we&#8217;ve gotten. We&#8217;re looking to use the money to hire key team members&#8230; and to launch the product on the market later [this year].&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Right now we&#8217;re really focused on product development and getting that off the ground and running,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;So trying to take also the advice &#8212; by YC &#8212; to heart to really collaborate with our customers as much as possible.&#8221;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"TgOLrJC9AT\\\"><p><a

href=\\\"https://firewalla.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Firewalla</a>&#8216;s combined firewall and router devices have made a name for themselves as the go-to hardware security tools for many enthusiasts and small businesses. Today, the company started shipping its newest device, the <a href=\\\"https://firewalla.com/products/firewalla-purple\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Firewalla Purple</a>, a diminutive gigabit firewall and router that is currently retailing for $319.</p>\\n<p>With the Purple, Firewalla, which was founded in 2015, is filling a hole in its lineup, which until now <a href=\\\"https://help.firewalla.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010465893\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">included</a> 100 Mbps and 500 Mbps devices for home and small business users with prices ranging from $129 to $199, as well as a $458 3 Gbps+ device for larger businesses. With many homes now having access to gigabit internet connections, though, the Purple slots in nicely in the middle there.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265093\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/purple_frontrack.png\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265093\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265093\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/purple_frontrack.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265093\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2265003\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>Like its other devices, the Purple&#8217;s core function is as a firewall, but with a device watching over your network, you can obviously do a lot more. In addition to monitoring and controlling your internet usage, the Purple also includes the ability to filter ads and provide parental controls to block access to adult content, for example, or to take the Xbox offline after a specific time. But it also can function as a VPN server and client and, if you want granular control over everything in your network, the Firewalla app allows you to go very deep into managing and shaping your network and traffic. To make that a bit easier, you can manage devices separately or group them in ways that make sense for your network and usage (I have groups for all of my desktops and IoT devices, for example).</p>\\n<p>One nifty feature of the Purple is that it features built-in Wi-Fi, so it can function as a travel router, but in a nifty twist, you can also tether it to your phone and provide internet connectivity to your network when your regular internet connection is down.</p>\\n<p>As Firewalla co-founder and CEO Jerry Chen told me, this Wi-Fi feature was originally something the company&#8217;s engineers wanted to play with &#8212; and I think that&#8217;s a good example of how Firewalla as a whole thinks about building its devices. &#8220;It&#8217;s all accidental,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;The travel thing is purely accidental. We build fault tolerance into [the Purple]. Then, our engineers just go &#8216;I want to play with this.&#8217; And they got another channel out from the same Wi-Fi chip.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Depending on your network configuration, you can either connect the USB C-powered device in line between your modem and router or simply connect it to your router like any other ethernet-wired device. Firewalla offers a pretty straightforward <a href=\\\"https://help.firewalla.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406178984467\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">guide</a> to doing so, and no matter which route you go, it shouldn&#8217;t take more than five minutes to get everything up and running.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265092\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265092\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265092\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"571\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png 2850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=1536,857 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=2048,1143 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=50,28 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265092\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p>\\n<p>There is one exception: If you use Google Wifi or Google Nest&#8217;s mesh routers, which don&#8217;t support a number of specific networking modes that Firewalla needs to see and manage all your networking traffic, your setup will be a <a href=\\\"https://help.firewalla.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048869274-Firewalla-Gold-Tutorial-Google-Wifi-or-Nest-Wifi-Mesh-network-with-Gold-Beta-\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">bit more complicated</a> or you may not be able to see all the details about traffic on the mesh network.</p>\\n<p>As Chen noted, the company has tried to talk to Google. &#8220;The problem with Google Wifi is it&#8217;s not trying to play nice with people,&#8221; he said, and explained how the mesh router simply can&#8217;t be put into bridge mode or AP mode, necessitating a relatively hacky workaround. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather people not use Google Wifi &#8212; it&#8217;s just a unit trying to be the king of your network and we don&#8217;t want that to happen,&#8221; the always outspoken Chen said.</p>\\n<p>As Chen noted, the majority of Firewalla users are prosumers &#8212; users who want (or think they want) more advanced networking features. Often, these users then take these devices and bring them into small businesses as well. While you could always go for a complex networking setup from vendors like Cisco, Firewalla&#8217;s advantage is that it is extremely easy to set up.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265107\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265107\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265107\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"771\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png 2085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=768,578 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=680,512 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=1536,1156 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=2048,1541 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=50,38 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265107\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p>\\n<p>&#8220;A lot of our customers are technology people &#8212; IT, InfoSec &#8212; and what I hear from them is &#8216;I want to go home. I don&#8217;t really want to do the stuff I do at work [at home] because it&#8217;s too complex for me. I want something simple &#8212; but not stupid&#8217;,&#8221; said Chen. Stupid, he argues, would be a button that simply says &#8220;secure.&#8221; That would be nice, but that&#8217;s not how security works. Instead, the company&#8217;s users want to be able to easily create rules and tune the network to their needs. &#8220;The best design is no button, but that&#8217;s not possible with security because security is not a no-button game,&#8221; said Chen.</p>\\n<p>For the user, that means the app for managing the device, while taking some getting used to, is mostly pretty intuitive &#8212; but if you want to delve deeper, you can set up custom routes and dig deep into the internals of your network. It won&#8217;t hold your hand, though. You can easily mess up, too. During the first couple of days, you&#8217;ll also get a lot of alerts, simply because you still have to teach the router what is normal traffic on your network and what is not.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265090\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265090\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265090\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"768\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265090\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p>\\n<p>As for the hardware, despite the chip and logistics crisis, which is also affecting Firewalla and its product lineup, the company is now able to ship the Purple router. But as Chen noted, where a few years ago, it took three weeks to build a device, 20 days to ship and then a few days to clear customs, it can now take months &#8212; and even though the company had locked in and paid deposits for production runs for its chips, manufacturers now often need more time and want to charge higher prices. An Ethernet MAC chip, he noted, used to cost cents, now the price is up to a few dollars.</p>\\n<p>Chen admitted that this put quite a bit of pressure on the company, which found itself in a bit of a cash crunch because of these delays. So while the pandemic helped the company grow a lot &#8212; with people at home looking to secure their networks &#8212; it also faced a lot of challenges on all fronts because of it. But it was able to weather the storm, in part through some inventive maneuvers. Since it wanted to get a few of the Purple&#8217;s out to beta testers early, for example, but couldn&#8217;t start a full production run, it wanted to do a micro build of 100 units &#8212; something that was expensive but that it was able to do fast because it was able to sneak it in as a sample run.</p>\\n<p>The one thing you won&#8217;t see Chen do anytime soon, though, is raise outside funding. Instead, the company was one of the early adopters of crowdfunding for its products. When he went to talk to VCs early on, the ones he talked to didn&#8217;t yet understand that consumers would want to bring these security tools to their homes.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;[The reason] we&#8217;re not VC-funded is because I&#8217;m an engineer. I just really can&#8217;t sit there and talk to VCs and pretend they know what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; said Chen.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"53KoM5jNvT\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/from-surviving-to-thriving-as-a-hardware-startup/\\\">From surviving to thriving as a hardware startup</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;From surviving to thriving as a hardware startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/from-surviving-to-thriving-as-a-hardware-startup/embed/#?secret=NaX0kjAWF1#?secret=53KoM5jNvT\\\" data-secret=\\\"53KoM5jNvT\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n\",\n          \"protected\": false\n        },\n        \"excerpt\": {\n          \"rendered\": \"<p>Over the course of the last few years, Firewalla&#8216;s combined firewall and router devices have made a name for themselves as the go-to hardware security tools for many enthusiasts and small businesses.

So the company — which allows companies like Okta, Salesforce and Zendesk to onboard new customers or get employees to adopt new software, as well as revealing analytics on that uptake — has been in a position to scale up its marketing for a while.</p>\\n<p>It’s now taking that to the next level with the acquisition of <a href=\\\"https://www.mindtheproduct.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Mind the Product</a> &#8212; a platform that many outside observers would call the key community of product managers &#8212; which dovetails nicely with Pendo’s mission. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>\\n<p>Starting in 2010 from London as a global meetup-style community with ProductTank (launched, typically, in a pub), Mind the Product has morphed into a community that provides content, training and conferences that claims to touch more than 300,000 product managers, designers and developers via seminars, newsletters, a Slack community and ProductTank meetups in more than 200 global cities.</p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2265096\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>James Mayes, CEO and co-founder of Mind the Product, said: “This is a tremendous day for our community of product managers around the world. By joining Pendo, we can execute on today’s mission and think even bigger about how we will support, educate and train product teams in the future.”</p>\\n<p>The full-time team of nearly 20 people will now join Pendo but retain its branding to manage its conferences, content, events and meetups, and to continue its vendor-neutral workshops and training.</p>\\n<p>Todd Olson, CEO, and co-founder of Pendo said: “Pendo has always made it part of our mission to elevate the craft of product management and to help product managers be better at what they do. We’re really excited to join forces with some of our earliest influencers, and offer substantially more education and resources to the global product management community for years to come.”</p>\\n<p>Mind the Product is Pendo’s third international acquisition in five years, as it previously acquired Insert, a mobile app engagement solution based in Israel, and, in 2019, Receptive Software, a U.K.-based product demand intelligence platform.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p>In a phone call interview with TechCrunch, Olson said: “We’ve been around since 2013. We have always focused on building product and supporting the product management community. So that&#8217;s part of what led us to this arrangement &#8212; but we&#8217;ve been selling the product and working with product managers since our inception. I was a head of product at SAAS company as well. So I am personally been very passionate about the product community in my professional career.”</p>\\n<p>“Since the very beginning of Pendo, in order for us to really achieve our mission, we needed to help elevate the craft of product management. The more there are great product managers the more that will ultimately benefit Pendo &#8212; maybe not immediately, but certainly in the arc of our company. That’s why Mind The Product fits so well with us,” he said.</p>\\n<p>Mayes added: “We&#8217;ve known Pendo pretty much since inception, as one of the sponsors that we have worked with over that time. One of the things that was really exciting about this deal was that Pendo was insistent that they wanted Mind the Product, as a conference, to remain open to other vendors. So Pendo will continue to run the &#8216;Pandemonium&#8217; event, which is essentially a user conference, whereas the Mind the Product will always welcome vendors of all stripes who have an interest in the product craft.”</p>\\n<p>Pendo now has over 160 people across the U.K., Israel, Japan and Australia.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"IAUPDEE8XY\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/product-manager-hiring-for-startups/\\\">How and when to hire your first product manager</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;How and when to hire your first product manager&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/product-manager-hiring-for-startups/embed/#?secret=mp32Dye4WE#?secret=IAUPDEE8XY\\\" data-secret=\\\"IAUPDEE8XY\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n\",\n          \"protected\": false\n        },\n        \"excerpt\": {\n          \"rendered\": \"<p>Last year product analytics and digital adoption platform Pendo pulled in $110 million investment from private equity firm Thoma Bravo, and that was not long after a $150 million tranche of funding.

The Bay Area daily local newsletter, which is reminiscent of a daily local paper, includes tops stories across local news, sports, politics, dining and more. The stories are compiled from numerous publications, including the San Francisco Chronicle, SF Gate, Eater San Francisco, KQED, The Oaklandside and others.</p>\\n<p>All of the stories included in the newsletter are curated by Apple News editors, as opposed to being selected by algorithms &#8212; a decision that should cut down on the recirculation of clickbait and other low-value content. Apple News considers the Bay Area newsletter to be a local’s end-of-day digest that includes notable news and other information about what&#8217;s happening around them. The daily local newsletter joins Apple News&#8217; daily newsletter that delivers national news to larger audiences.</p>\\n<p>The launch arrives at a time when a number of tech companies are adding newsletters as part of their offerings, including Twitter with its <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/\\\">acquisition of Revue</a> and <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/\\\">Facebook&#8217;s newsletter platform Bulletin</a>, for example.

And despite public markets’ rocky start in early January, we’re confident that 2022 will be another banner year for the sector.</p>\\n<p>In this year’s edition of the Matrix Fintech Index, we’ll look at the performance of public fintech versus the broader market in 2021 and reflect on the private fintech market’s red-hot year. Then, we’ll turn our attention to the year ahead and offer some predictions for fintech in 2022.</p>\\n<h2>Fintech continued to outperform the market by 3x</h2>\\n<p>The Matrix Fintech Index has significantly outperformed major public stock indexes as well as a basket of legacy financial service providers for the fifth year in a row. As a reminder, the Matrix Fintech Index is a market-cap weighted index that tracks a portfolio of 25 leading public fintech companies.</p>\\n<p>Despite a roughly 30% draw-down in the last months of 2021, the Matrix Fintech Index continued to beat the broader market as well as incumbent financial service companies. Fintech’s consistent outperformance signals that the changes brought about by COVID-19 – including shifts toward e-commerce, online payments and digital interactions over physical ones – are here to stay.</p>\\n<p>\\t<div class=\\\"article-block block--pullout block--right\\\">\\n\\t\\t<blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 2022 opened with shaky markets and signs of multiple compression, but we believe this year will set another record with at least $300 billion in fintech liquidity.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\t</p>\\n<h2>A great year of public debuts</h2>\\n<p>Last year was outstanding for fintech IPOs, with notable debuts occurring across several categories. Consumer companies such as Coinbase ($86 billion) and Robinhood ($32 billion), infrastructure players such as dLocal ($6 billion) and Marqeta ($15 billion), and insurtech providers such as Lemonade ($1.6 billion) all entered the public market.</p>\\n<p>There was also increased diversity in the way these companies went public, with some fintechs skipping the traditional IPO process altogether. More companies, such as Coinbase in the U.S. or Wise in the U.K., chose direct listings, while Robinhood earmarked $700 million in shares for its existing customers.</p>\\n<p>Others, including Hippo, Metromile and SoFi, chose to go public via SPAC. While SPACs&#8217; track records have been mixed, even accounting for recent market volatility, the rise of IPO alternatives is a welcome change for the growing ranks of late-stage fintech unicorns.</p>\\n<h2>A record year with 151 new unicorns</h2>\\n<p>Private markets followed public markets in making 2021 a record-setting year. VC funding into private fintech companies crossed $134 billion in 2021, rising by 177% from a year earlier, according to <a

Crypto investments are <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/01/despite-bumps-crypto-investment-starts-2022-with-a-roar/\\\">already seeing a good start to 2022 building off record hype in 2021</a>.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When asked to confirm the crypto focus, Ohanian told TechCrunch that 776 follows “the lead of the smartest founders we meet.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So if they keep building in Web3, we’ll keep funding them,” Ohanian said. “We’re also seeing a strong push into climate tech, space tech, food tech and still good old-fashioned SaaS businesses.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As for how 776 sources its deals, the investor said that for now, it’s a “really old-fashioned” process in which leads mostly come via email or text and then end up in Cerebro, the operating system his firm developed.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“</span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">That will improve this year with some more product to widen our top-of-funnel,” Ohanian said.</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Cerebro is its first product and is designed to give founders a way to search 776’s network of 44,000 contracts and request an introduction “with one click.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The thinking behind the technology was simple. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“We have a great network that returns our emails and it’s not a good task for a human brain to be asked ‘hey do you know someone at twitter? Do you know a machine learning engineer?’” said Ohanian. “It’s much better to query a database anytime you want to.”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">All of 776’s work lives there and that too is by design, he said. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">“This creates transparency and accountability – not only within our team, but also with our founders and investors,” Ohanian told TechCrunch. “The goal is to scale the most valuable and most productizable parts of our work first, so that when we spend time with our founders it’s the kind of work only humans can do well (empathy, strategy, creativity).”</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When launching 776’s first fund, the firm said explicitly that it </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">sought a diverse investor base, of which 50% identified as female and 15% as Black or Indigenous people. </span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So how’s it doing?</span></p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The firm invites all its LPs to participate in a biannual, </span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">in-depth demographic survey.

Shortly thereafter, it <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/\\\">sold its enterprise business</a>, its primary source of revenue, before eventually promoting longtime exec Scott Johnston to CEO.</p>\\n<p>At that time, it also<a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/after-selling-enterprise-biz-docker-lands-35m-investment-and-new-ceo/\\\"> took on new funding</a> going back almost to square one, actually taking on the investment as a Series A company. It simultaneously implemented a new developer-centered strategy while dropping from 400 employees down to just 60. A few months later, the first wave of the pandemic hit. It was not an easy time, according to Johnston, who had to steer the company through this instability.</p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2265183\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>&#8220;November 2019 was a time [fraught] with risk and uncertainty but we believed in the tailwinds of the market, we believed in the developers&#8217; love of our product, and that we could come together as a team, focus on the developer, deliver great products and build a legitimate business,&#8221; Johnston told me.</p>\\n<p>Docker had a couple of things going for it, even with that uncertainty. It had widespread brand recognition among developers and was synonymous with containerization, a way to package and deliver software as individual services in the cloud, rather than one monolithic application.</p>\\n<p>It also has a bunch of open source pieces that can act as the top of the funnel for eventual sales activity, with the goal of turning some of the users of the free products into paying customers. That appears to have happened with increasing frequency over the last year, judging from the company&#8217;s ARR growth over that period.</p>\\n<p>The goal in the early days of the restructuring was to capture that developer momentum around the brand and deliver them the free open source products, then expand into the paid products over time for a certain percentage of them. This was a very different approach from what they took when they were selling Docker Enterprise and were generally selling to IT, rather than developers or their managers.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"wby472V2cQ\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company/\\\">Docker regroups as cloud-native developer tool company</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;Docker regroups as cloud-native developer tool company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company/embed/#?secret=q5CHDSDsF5#?secret=wby472V2cQ\\\" data-secret=\\\"wby472V2cQ\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n<p>That product-led growth approach worked from a commercial perspective when the managers began buying related commercial tools. &#8220;So when the developer has a great experience using the free product, and as they and their organizations scale their use of the products, then there&#8217;s features that managers value that they are willing to pay for.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>He added, &#8220;What you&#8217;re seeing with the financial performance that we described <a href=\\\"https://www.docker.com/blog/celebrating-our-second-fiscal-year/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">in our blog post</a> that&#8217;s driven purely from those large organizations that realize these productivity benefits … and are willing to pay for the management security tools to enable organization-wide adoption.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Docker was founded in 2013 before restructuring in 2019. At the time it sold its enterprise business to Mirantis, the company took on <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/after-selling-enterprise-biz-docker-lands-35m-investment-and-new-ceo/\\\">a $35 million Series A</a> investment from Benchmark Capital and Insight Partners.

Time will tell if the strategy is successful or not.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>With over $50 million in ARR, the jury may still be out, but it&#8217;s certainly headed in the right direction with results I reckon most investors would be happy with.

For rental owners with a good number of units, they can pay for the collected information, allowing landlords to track how they are performing with their customers, how many of their current tenants intend to stay, and so forth.</p>\\n<p>The startup charges building owners $2 per unit, per month for its software, a figure that Ezeugwu said can be discounted for larger contract volumes. The startup has plans to expand its feature set, naturally, allowing it to charge more in time. An example the CEO provided during our chat was using natural language processing (NLP) to find trends in written reviews, which could help companies with hundreds of units better parse incoming feedback.</p>\\n<p>Before it launched its software product, WYL generated revenue through brand partnerships with companies like Allstate and others that sell to folks who rent. Presumably, the company can continue that work to supplement its software incomes, though we anticipate that WYL will become a majority software business in time &#8212; if it isn&#8217;t already &#8212; from a revenue perspective.</p>\\n<p>The idea of underestimated founders is bandied about in startup land pretty often. And yet if we rifled through the latest few hundred funding rounds, you might wind up wondering if anything has changed at all.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p>Black Ops co-founder <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/motownini\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">James Norman</a> told TechCrunch about his own fundraising journey for his company, <a href=\\\"https://www.pilot.ly/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Pilot.ly</a>, when explaining the impetus behind his venture group. In Norman&#8217;s view, Black founders are underinvested in, which means that his firm may have access to deal flow that competing venture firms are overlooking and that the founders he wanted to invest in are &#8220;the biggest arbitrage opportunity to tech.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Now flush with its largest investment to date and a software product in-market &#8212; after running pilots for the SaaS offering last year, WYL has onboarded 7,000 units, the CEO said &#8212; the startup intends to hire and keep building. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale its software incomes. If that goes according to plan, it shouldn&#8217;t have to wait another seven years for external investor interest to manifest in the form of a seven-figure check.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><em>The startup

\"rendered\": \"<p id=\\\"speakable-summary\\\">Rising pressure on big business to address the threat of climate change by decarbonizing their ops has, in recent years, led to huge demand for carbon offset schemes &#8212; enabling companies to buy carbon credits to &#8216;offset&#8217; emissions so they can claim to be &#8216;greening&#8217; their activities, without having to make more substantial changes (like, say, an airline running fewer planes).</p>\\n<p>Unsurprisingly this has created lots of wonky incentives attached to forestry resources and carbon offsetting projects. Which, in turn, is creating lots of knock-on startup opportunities.</p>\\n<p>One example of dubious carbon offsetting involves existing woodlands being repurposed for carbon credits in a way that <a href=\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-17/the-real-trees-delivering-fake-climate-progress-for-corporate-america\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">artificially inflates the claimed credit</a> &#8212; such as by claiming a forest was going to be cut down when it wasn&#8217;t, meaning there is no net increase in carbon sequestered (and a woodland is essentially just repurposed to help corporates greenwash their pollutive &#8216;business as usual&#8217;). So without robust oversight carbon offsetting projects can clearly be a sink for kicking the climate can down the road towards disaster.</p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2264900\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>Similarly, greenwashing pressures have led to the awful sight of trees being chopped up for biomass and burnt &#8212; under a <a href=\\\"https://physicsworld.com/a/biomass-energy-green-or-dirty/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">dubious claim of &#8216;green energy&#8217;</a>. Here, too, there&#8217;s a need for rigorous accountancy &#8212; in the form of a full lifecycle analysis of a biomass project &#8212; else the risks can even go beyond meaningless greenwashing to actively harmful environmental outcomes (such as a loss of mature woodlands and another net reduction in how much carbon is sequestered).</p>\\n<p>Pressure on companies to quickly get on a path to carbon neutrality is, very evidently, generating huge but often poorly directed demand to stand up glossy marketing pledges that claim to be &#8216;tackling&#8217; climate change.</p>\\n<p>The overarching question is whether anything of value is being done with this corporate reputation spend when it comes to actually preventing catastrophic climate change?</p>\\n<p>Turns out this too is a burgeoning startup business opportunity.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p>Startups applying technologies to target the accountability/credibility gap around carbon offsetting by proposing schemes to verify the credibility of projects and monitor performance include the likes of <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/as-concerns-rise-over-forest-carbon-offsets-pachamas-verified-offset-marketplace-gets-15-million/\\\">Pachama</a> and <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/sylvera-series-a/\\\">Sylvera</a>, which are both backed by some major investors &#8212; with around $25M and $39M raised respectively to date.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"0a51Fc3y0Z\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/sylvera-series-a/\\\">Sylvera takes $32M to build trust in carbon offsetting ratings</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;Sylvera takes $32M to build trust in carbon offsetting ratings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/sylvera-series-a/embed/#?secret=9yK8iISXFj#?secret=0a51Fc3y0Z\\\" data-secret=\\\"0a51Fc3y0Z\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n<p>There are also startups focused on expanding access to carbon markets so that smaller landowners can get looped into revenue-generating carbon offsets for their woodlands. Such as US-focused <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/silviaterra-wants-to-bring-the-benefits-of-carbon-offsets-to-every-landowner-everywhere/\\\">Silvia Terra</a>.</p>\\n<p>The prospect of receiving recurring revenue for conserving forestry may at least held protect woodlands from other forms of development that could see trees felled to make way for different money-generating schemes with less or no carbon sequestering benefits. But &#8212; clearly &#8212; forestry conservation alone isn&#8217;t going to be enough to reduce global carbon emissions.</p>\\n<p>Hence other climate startups are focused on expanding the volume of forested landmass. Such as <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/terraformation-gets-30m-to-fight-climate-change-with-rapid-reforesting/\\\">Terraformation</a> &#8212; which is using a mix of old and new technologies to rapidly reforest wasteland with the goal of increasing the amount of global landmass that&#8217;s covered by trees.</p>\\n<p>Again, though, even tree planting has been <a href=\\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/tree-planting-wont-stop-climate-crisis-1020500/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">criticized as a flawed &#8220;magical thinking&#8221; non-solution to climate change</a>.</p>\\n<p>In some cases, poor incentives to simply increase forestry volume have led to native tree species being ripped out and replaced with faster growing alternatives &#8212; leading to biodiversity loss and a forestry monoculture that&#8217;s less resilient to the challenges of a changing climate. Which is also, ultimately, environmentally counterproductive.</p>\\n<p>Climate change increases the risk of drought, storms and forest fire &#8212; all of which can decimate forests. So mindless tree planting projects that fail to effectively model risks, don&#8217;t selectively and sensitivity plant, and fail to follow through with good forestry management to ensure the long term success of a woodland are also best filed under pointless (and even potentially harmful) greenwashing.</p>\\n<p>The sad truth is that, globally, forests are still being felled at a far faster rate than they&#8217;re being replanted &#8212; and ultimately that net destruction is fuelled by the unreconstructed demands of industry and the system of growth-focused consumption that powers the modern world.</p>\\n<p>Without systemic restructuring of how we consume and trade towards a reformed, circular economy that revolves around reuse and longevity it&#8217;s hard to see how the rapacious global engine of demand can be dialled back to an environmentally sustainable level &#8212; in which trees and all the rest of life on Earth (including humans) can survive and thrive far into the future.</p>\\n<p>Given such vast challenges &#8212; not to mention the incremental timescales involve in anything attached to forestry ecosystems &#8212; startups that are trying to make a meaningful difference in this space certainly have their work cut out.</p>\\n<h2>Optimizing for forest survival</h2>\\n<p>YC-backed <a href=\\\"https://pina.earth/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Pina Earth</a> is a relative newcomer (founded 2021) that&#8217;s trying to tackle some of the problematic incentives around carbon offsetting projects by creating smarter skews that encourage landowners to increase woodland biodiversity and future-proof forests against the hotter, harsher climate that&#8217;s fast coming at us.</p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s doing this by pitching forest owners on making sustainable improvements to existing woodlands that will enable them to get certification for additional carbon credits &#8212; i.e. on top of whatever their woodland may already be bringing in &#8212; generating a &#8220;recurring income&#8221; via selling any extra stored carbon to the scores of companies eager to top up their offsetting.</p>\\n<p>So while some carbon offsetting atop existing woodlands may be accused of bogus greenwashing, here at least the premise is that carbon credits are being attached to &#8212;

L to R: Fincke, Biermann, Kerber. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pina Earth</p></div></p>\\n<p>Their idea is to sell landowners on the financial value of good woodland management &#8212; linking sustainable forestry to additional carbon credits which mean there&#8217;s a financial reward for making the kinds of relatively costly interventions that are likely to be needed to make woodlands more productive (in carbon sequestering terms) and resilient to climate change over the longer term.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Essentially we&#8217;re building an online platform where we&#8217;re connecting forest owners and carbon credit buyers,&#8221; explains Biermann. &#8220;Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for forest owners to be rewarded for the ecosystem services they provide.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;In the projects that we do we&#8217;re trying to change the species diversity of the forest over time to make it more resilient to climate change,&#8221; she adds.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s really our goal &#8212; to democratize access to this market, to the voluntary carbon market in this case, where I think for one of the first times you&#8217;re able to align ecology and economy in a very productive way,&#8221; she also tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The way that it works in the forest timeline is you actually give out future-looking carbon credits &#8212; this is quite common in the forestry carbon credit scene because they&#8217;re just slow ecosystems. So you&#8217;re trying to overcome this by paying someone now for the carbon that will be sequestered a bit later on.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;With the monitoring cycle that we have of about three years this is something that we would then align to these vintages of carbon credits being given out in three year cycles to keep incentivizing the forest owners to keep doing the restructuring project over time.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Albeit she won&#8217;t be drawn into predicting exactly how much extra income a landowner might be able to generate through additional carbon credits. (She says the price will &#8220;depend&#8221; on a variety of per-project factors, such as the existing tree species and how much optimization is possible.)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the challenge we&#8217;re trying to address the whole way through is incentivizing someone to do something now that will pay off in let&#8217;s say 30 or 40 years because forests are just very slow ecosystems,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;As a startup I think that&#8217;s quite an interesting challenge because us starting into this journey &#8212; the effects of this will take place a lot later, so once we are kind of close to the end of our work life, so I think that&#8217;s a very interesting perspective on the timeframe, also as a startup founder.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To support its long term environmental mission, Pina Earth is building a platform that helps landowners with the admin side of project certification, especially to make it easier for smaller landowners to access carbon markers &#8212; while also taking care of the remote sensing and AI modelling to quantify a project&#8217;s carbon outputs and &#8212; it hopes &#8212; increase the speed and quality of carbon credits derived from the forestry.</p>\\n<p>There are a couple of components to Pina Earth&#8217;s product (which is still pre-commercial launch).</p>\\n<p>Firstly process automation: It&#8217;s building out a platform to support landowners through what can be a complex certification process vs manually filling in scores of forms.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265060\\\" style=\\\"width: 690px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265060\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-large wp-image-2265060\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?w=680\\\" alt=\\\"Pina Earth - Dashboard\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"619\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=150,137 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=300,273 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=768,699 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=680,619 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=1536,1398 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=2048,1864 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pina-Earth-Dashboard.png?resize=50,46 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\\\" /><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265060\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Pina Earth project dashboard. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Pina Earth</p></div></p>\\n<p>The second, back-end element involves complex data processing and modelling, such as using machine learning to predict how climate change might affect future growth of the forest and impact its ability to sequester carbon.</p>\\n<p>To power this and conduct ongoing <span style=\\\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">remote monitoring of the projects Pina Earth is pulling in and processing 2D and 3D data on forests, captured via sensors attached to ultralight aircraft (it partners with a third party to do the actual data gathering). </span></p>\\n<p>She says they considered a range of possible methods for remotely capturing data to monitor the carbon offsetting projects &#8212; from drones to satellites &#8212; but settled on hobby planes as best suited to capture the level of data needed for it to be able to quantify improvements to forests.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the middle with this approach of using ultralight aircraft data because the type of project that we&#8217;re focusing on &#8212; improved forest management &#8212; actually requires an improved resolution [vs satellite data] to be able to detect the tree species,&#8221; she notes.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our goal &#8212; with these improved forest management projects &#8212; is we try to summate into the future what will happen to this particular forest under climate change. Because especially in Germany &#8212; but also throughout Europe &#8212; we&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of forests dying due to droughts, bark beetles, storms. And we&#8217;re trying to incentivize forest owners to change the structure of these forests that are mostly monocultures &#8212; usually one type of tree species &#8212; to a biodiverse mix.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Biermann likens the approach to diversifying a financial portfolio &#8212; i.e. in order to make it &#8220;less prone to risk in the future&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>As well as increasing the mix of of trees in a woodland as a strategy to reduce disease risk, she mentions that having forestry where growth is managed so as not to have all the trees at the same height can help with resilience to storms, for example.</p>\\n<p>She suggests it may also be the case that landowners need to plant different, even non-local tree species that may be more resistant to the hotter temperatures and drought conditions which are associated with climate change.</p>\\n<p>Per Biermann, Pina Earth is planning to do monitoring of projects about every three years &#8212; &#8220;to have a tighter net on what&#8217;s going on on the ground in this forest; is it developing in the way we&#8217;d like it to?&#8221;, as she puts it.</p>\\n<p>Doing remote monitoring of forests allows for more regular monitoring vs traditional on the ground methods, which &#8212; she suggests &#8212; helps improve the quality of the carbon credit. She says its method is able to transform the 2D and 3D forestry data it gets as a raw input into &#8220;single tree-based carbon storage&#8221; validation of projects.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think what&#8217;s also unique in our approach is that we simulate carbon sequestration of every single tree that we detected into the future under changing regional climate conditions,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;This allows us to optimize for this forest&#8217;s survival probability and sequester more carbon. So I think there&#8217;s where we have a unique twist to forest carbon projects because we&#8217;re very much focused on making those forests climate resilient.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>While the startup&#8217;s initial business model is focused on charging forest owners for its SaaS, Biermann says ultimately they want to be able to offer the tech for free to maximize access &#8212; but would then charge a cut on any extra carbon credits generated.</p>\\n<p>However that could create a potential conflict of interest &#8212; since Pina Earth is also involved in assessing the quality and performance of the projects.</p>\\n<p>Asked how it would resolve that conflict Biermann says it&#8217;s working with a German non-profit &#8212; which has a technical advisory board that spans environmental organizations, forestry science and the carbon credit market &#8212; and she envisages such an independent entity being involved in helping to verify the carbon credits as an additional accountability layer.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re partnering with this local non-profit that&#8217;s developing a domestic German forest carbon standard,&#8221; she says, adding.  &#8220;Since they are also just developing this we&#8217;re working very closely to get our data interactions points very aligned so that there won&#8217;t be the downside of having larger costs and having a longer process to get certified&#8230; In this case working with this non-profit that&#8217;s also doing the stakeholder consultation really gives this additional trust and allows us to not have this conflict of interest because there&#8217;s another party also looking at the project.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Discussing generally how it stands up the accuracy of its data, she says it&#8217;s using terrestrial forest data (which landowners usually already have) at the start of a project to benchmark the accuracy of its models when it&#8217;s using remote sensing.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This ground-truthing with terrestrial data&#8217;s really important to use to be able to show we can get close to these results,&#8221; she says, adding: &#8220;The other side of it, I think, is more related to having a stakeholder dialogue &#8212; to get everybody on board, all kinds of different organizations, because you have to agree on the way a forest carbon credit is actually generated, and for that we&#8217;re partnering with [local] organizations.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Biermann says Pina Earth is also intending to put its method through a public consultation process &#8212; and its website notes that its open data approach will include purchased carbon credits being &#8220;r<span style=\\\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">etired in a public registry&#8221; to ensure they can only be used once &#8212; &#8220;to make sure that we don&#8217;t have any blind spots&#8221;. </span></p>\\n<p>Given the rising numbers of carbon offsetting validation startups there are likely to be growing opportunities for other types of partnerships that may further help drive accountability.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s actually one of the most exciting things of working in this particular segment because at least from our experience everybody is so open to partnering because the bottom line is you&#8217;re trying to remove carbon from the atmosphere and you&#8217;re trying to create this sustainable impact so if we could achieve this by partnering I think everybody is kind of on board, so there&#8217;s usually not a long discussion on this,&#8221; adds Biermann. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more collaborative, I think, than other environments.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>What about if forest projects don&#8217;t perform as it projected when it handed out the carbon credit?</p>\\n<p>On that, Biermann says it&#8217;s built in multiple safeguards &#8212; starting with making conservative assumptions on the science side.</p>\\n<p>It is also structuring the credit system with a &#8220;risk buffer&#8221;, whereby a certain percentage of carbon credits are pooled across all projects, so aren&#8217;t given out, &#8220;as an internal insurance mechanism&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We are also doing this frequent monitoring cycle because we want to be able to incorporate new science as it comes out,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Thankfully this is a really active science scene and we are quite close to the scientific community un our startup so also with our measurements and monitoring we want to adjust to and adapt to whenever anything new is found out&#8230; to really guarantee this high quality carbon credit, also for the carbon credit buyer side.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>On the wider critique of carbon offsetting &#8212; i.e. that it generates greenwashing by creating a means for companies to pay to avoid making systemic changes that will lead to net reductions in their own carbon emissions &#8212; Biermann agrees this can be a problem.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Some carbon credits projects have been questioned on the way they set up their methodology and that&#8217;s why we went through all of the forest methodologies that are out there for domestic and international standards for voluntary carbon projects to rethink the criteria and to try to automate the documentation to, again, democratize access to these but also to really think about what does a high credit have to show? What&#8217;s important to do in terms of data?&#8221; she also says.</p>\\n<p>To try to avoid Pina Earth ending up inadvertently working for greenwashers, Biermann says it&#8217;s partnering with organizations that are doing carbon footprinting for corporates.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Partnering with them I think is important because then they&#8217;re the part who does the footprint calculation, according to official criteria. They first work on reduction methods and only then do they resort to offset projects. So I see ourselves very much in this chain &#8212; and the important of other partners who work on footprinting and reduction,&#8221; she suggests.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;There are so many startups working on different issues &#8212; let&#8217;s say of the carbon credit value chain &#8212; I can think of a lot of other problem areas where it would be great if other startups started; having a way to really tell the footprint of a company through the scope 1, 2, 3 [emissions]. Being able to make that transparent. Yeah, so a lot of transparency issues along the value chain are being tackled by different startups&#8230; And those are the ones we get to partner with, essentially.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>On the go to market front, Pina Earth is focused initially on its home turf and forests of Germany &#8212; where it is currently operating two projects across 1,200 hectares as it prepares to launch later this year.</p>\\n<p>But Biermann says it believes its approach can scale across Europe &#8212; and she <span style=\\\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\">mentions France, Spain as other countries of &#8220;particular&#8221; interest, because they have quite similar forest structures to Germany so it reckons it could easily transfer its methods there. </span></p>\\n<p>The UK is another potential market it&#8217;s eyeing expanding into, she adds.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;An advantage with these countries is they already have domestic forest carbon standards &#8212; in the UK that would be the woodland carbon code for example,&#8221; she notes. &#8220;And we could then apply to get our methodology approved with them to develop these types of improved forest management projects under a domestic standard in a different country.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Sadly, a <a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2438-y\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">study</a> published in 2020 found that Europe&#8217;s forest biomass has seen a <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/europe-losing-forest-to-harvesting-at-alarming-rate-data-suggests\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">dramatic rise in the rate of loss</a> since 2015 &#8212; likely as a result of increased demand for timber and to burn wood for biomass. So the trend curve is not bending in the right direction.</p>\\n<p>Albeit that means there&#8217;s even greater imperative to nudge regional landowners towards sustainable forestry and caring for &#8212; not cutting down &#8212; their precious woodlands.</p>\\n<p>What&#8217;s Biermann prediction for the future of forestry? Is every woodland going to be end up under some form of high tech surveillance and carbon quantification &#8212; with such tech becoming a key conservation tool, given the still rising pressures on natural ecosystems?</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It comes back to if you don&#8217;t really measure it you can&#8217;t really incentivize it and you can&#8217;t really value it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;At least in the way that our economy works. So I think it would be really beneficial for forests to be measured more closely and to then brought to the attention of the public and investors.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think we can see a shift towards this &#8212; I think it goes beyond climate investments being done for the climate&#8217;s sake but because it is the next wave of innovation and economic opportunity. So I think in that sense these monitoring systems will become more applicable to also other forest areas.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Currently Pina Earth is in YC&#8217;s Winter batch &#8212; so is focused on getting ready for demo day.</p>\\n<p>The $500k in funding it&#8217;s received via the accelerator is its first external investment, with the founders having bootstrapped early research and development of the product.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We had a couple of grants that helped us bootstrap along the way and this is the first equity funding now that we&#8217;ve gotten. We&#8217;re looking to use the money to hire key team members&#8230; and to launch the product on the market later [this year].&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Right now we&#8217;re really focused on product development and getting that off the ground and running,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;So trying to take also the advice &#8212; by YC &#8212; to heart to really collaborate with our customers as much as possible.&#8221;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"TgOLrJC9AT\\\"><p><a

href=\\\"https://firewalla.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Firewalla</a>&#8216;s combined firewall and router devices have made a name for themselves as the go-to hardware security tools for many enthusiasts and small businesses. Today, the company started shipping its newest device, the <a href=\\\"https://firewalla.com/products/firewalla-purple\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Firewalla Purple</a>, a diminutive gigabit firewall and router that is currently retailing for $319.</p>\\n<p>With the Purple, Firewalla, which was founded in 2015, is filling a hole in its lineup, which until now <a href=\\\"https://help.firewalla.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010465893\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">included</a> 100 Mbps and 500 Mbps devices for home and small business users with prices ranging from $129 to $199, as well as a $458 3 Gbps+ device for larger businesses. With many homes now having access to gigabit internet connections, though, the Purple slots in nicely in the middle there.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265093\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/purple_frontrack.png\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265093\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265093\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/purple_frontrack.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265093\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2265003\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>Like its other devices, the Purple&#8217;s core function is as a firewall, but with a device watching over your network, you can obviously do a lot more. In addition to monitoring and controlling your internet usage, the Purple also includes the ability to filter ads and provide parental controls to block access to adult content, for example, or to take the Xbox offline after a specific time. But it also can function as a VPN server and client and, if you want granular control over everything in your network, the Firewalla app allows you to go very deep into managing and shaping your network and traffic. To make that a bit easier, you can manage devices separately or group them in ways that make sense for your network and usage (I have groups for all of my desktops and IoT devices, for example).</p>\\n<p>One nifty feature of the Purple is that it features built-in Wi-Fi, so it can function as a travel router, but in a nifty twist, you can also tether it to your phone and provide internet connectivity to your network when your regular internet connection is down.</p>\\n<p>As Firewalla co-founder and CEO Jerry Chen told me, this Wi-Fi feature was originally something the company&#8217;s engineers wanted to play with &#8212; and I think that&#8217;s a good example of how Firewalla as a whole thinks about building its devices. &#8220;It&#8217;s all accidental,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;The travel thing is purely accidental. We build fault tolerance into [the Purple]. Then, our engineers just go &#8216;I want to play with this.&#8217; And they got another channel out from the same Wi-Fi chip.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Depending on your network configuration, you can either connect the USB C-powered device in line between your modem and router or simply connect it to your router like any other ethernet-wired device. Firewalla offers a pretty straightforward <a href=\\\"https://help.firewalla.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406178984467\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">guide</a> to doing so, and no matter which route you go, it shouldn&#8217;t take more than five minutes to get everything up and running.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265092\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265092\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265092\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"571\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png 2850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=1536,857 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=2048,1143 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Purple_Sideview.png?resize=50,28 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265092\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p>\\n<p>There is one exception: If you use Google Wifi or Google Nest&#8217;s mesh routers, which don&#8217;t support a number of specific networking modes that Firewalla needs to see and manage all your networking traffic, your setup will be a <a href=\\\"https://help.firewalla.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048869274-Firewalla-Gold-Tutorial-Google-Wifi-or-Nest-Wifi-Mesh-network-with-Gold-Beta-\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">bit more complicated</a> or you may not be able to see all the details about traffic on the mesh network.</p>\\n<p>As Chen noted, the company has tried to talk to Google. &#8220;The problem with Google Wifi is it&#8217;s not trying to play nice with people,&#8221; he said, and explained how the mesh router simply can&#8217;t be put into bridge mode or AP mode, necessitating a relatively hacky workaround. &#8220;We&#8217;d rather people not use Google Wifi &#8212; it&#8217;s just a unit trying to be the king of your network and we don&#8217;t want that to happen,&#8221; the always outspoken Chen said.</p>\\n<p>As Chen noted, the majority of Firewalla users are prosumers &#8212; users who want (or think they want) more advanced networking features. Often, these users then take these devices and bring them into small businesses as well. While you could always go for a complex networking setup from vendors like Cisco, Firewalla&#8217;s advantage is that it is extremely easy to set up.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265107\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265107\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265107\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"771\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png 2085w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=768,578 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=680,512 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=1536,1156 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=2048,1541 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/App_features_static.png?resize=50,38 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265107\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p>\\n<p>&#8220;A lot of our customers are technology people &#8212; IT, InfoSec &#8212; and what I hear from them is &#8216;I want to go home.

Instead, the company&#8217;s users want to be able to easily create rules and tune the network to their needs. &#8220;The best design is no button, but that&#8217;s not possible with security because security is not a no-button game,&#8221; said Chen.</p>\\n<p>For the user, that means the app for managing the device, while taking some getting used to, is mostly pretty intuitive &#8212; but if you want to delve deeper, you can set up custom routes and dig deep into the internals of your network. It won&#8217;t hold your hand, though. You can easily mess up, too. During the first couple of days, you&#8217;ll also get a lot of alerts, simply because you still have to teach the router what is normal traffic on your network and what is not.</p>\\n<p><div id=\\\"attachment_2265090\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg\\\"><img aria-describedby=\\\"caption-attachment-2265090\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2265090\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"768\\\" srcset=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vpnclient.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><p id=\\\"caption-attachment-2265090\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Firewalla</p></div></p>\\n<p>As for the hardware, despite the chip and logistics crisis, which is also affecting Firewalla and its product lineup, the company is now able to ship the Purple router. But as Chen noted, where a few years ago, it took three weeks to build a device, 20 days to ship and then a few days to clear customs, it can now take months &#8212; and even though the company had locked in and paid deposits for production runs for its chips, manufacturers now often need more time and want to charge higher prices. An Ethernet MAC chip, he noted, used to cost cents, now the price is up to a few dollars.</p>\\n<p>Chen admitted that this put quite a bit of pressure on the company, which found itself in a bit of a cash crunch because of these delays. So while the pandemic helped the company grow a lot &#8212; with people at home looking to secure their networks &#8212; it also faced a lot of challenges on all fronts because of it. But it was able to weather the storm, in part through some inventive maneuvers. Since it wanted to get a few of the Purple&#8217;s out to beta testers early, for example, but couldn&#8217;t start a full production run, it wanted to do a micro build of 100 units &#8212; something that was expensive but that it was able to do fast because it was able to sneak it in as a sample run.</p>\\n<p>The one thing you won&#8217;t see Chen do anytime soon, though, is raise outside funding. Instead, the company was one of the early adopters of crowdfunding for its products. When he went to talk to VCs early on, the ones he talked to didn&#8217;t yet understand that consumers would want to bring these security tools to their homes.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;[The reason] we&#8217;re not VC-funded is because I&#8217;m an engineer. I just really can&#8217;t sit there and talk to VCs and pretend they know what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; said Chen.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"53KoM5jNvT\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/from-surviving-to-thriving-as-a-hardware-startup/\\\">From surviving to thriving as a hardware startup</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;From surviving to thriving as a hardware startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/from-surviving-to-thriving-as-a-hardware-startup/embed/#?secret=NaX0kjAWF1#?secret=53KoM5jNvT\\\" data-secret=\\\"53KoM5jNvT\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n\",\n                    \"protected\": false\n                },\n                \"excerpt\": {\n                    \"rendered\": \"<p>Over the course of the last few years, Firewalla&#8216;s combined firewall and router devices have made a name for themselves as the go-to hardware security tools for many enthusiasts and small businesses.

By joining Pendo, we can execute on today’s mission and think even bigger about how we will support, educate and train product teams in the future.”</p>\\n<p>The full-time team of nearly 20 people will now join Pendo but retain its branding to manage its conferences, content, events and meetups, and to continue its vendor-neutral workshops and training.</p>\\n<p>Todd Olson, CEO, and co-founder of Pendo said: “Pendo has always made it part of our mission to elevate the craft of product management and to help product managers be better at what they do. We’re really excited to join forces with some of our earliest influencers, and offer substantially more education and resources to the global product management community for years to come.”</p>\\n<p>Mind the Product is Pendo’s third international acquisition in five years, as it previously acquired Insert, a mobile app engagement solution based in Israel, and, in 2019, Receptive Software, a U.K.-based product demand intelligence platform.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p>In a phone call interview with TechCrunch, Olson said: “We’ve been around since 2013. We have always focused on building product and supporting the product management community. So that&#8217;s part of what led us to this arrangement &#8212; but we&#8217;ve been selling the product and working with product managers since our inception. I was a head of product at SAAS company as well. So I am personally been very passionate about the product community in my professional career.”</p>\\n<p>“Since the very beginning of Pendo, in order for us to really achieve our mission, we needed to help elevate the craft of product management. The more there are great product managers the more that will ultimately benefit Pendo &#8212; maybe not immediately, but certainly in the arc of our company. That’s why Mind The Product fits so well with us,” he said.</p>\\n<p>Mayes added: “We&#8217;ve known Pendo pretty much since inception, as one of the sponsors that we have worked with over that time. One of the things that was really exciting about this deal was that Pendo was insistent that they wanted Mind the Product, as a conference, to remain open to other vendors. So Pendo will continue to run the &#8216;Pandemonium&#8217; event, which is essentially a user conference, whereas the Mind the Product will always welcome vendors of all stripes who have an interest in the product craft.”</p>\\n<p>Pendo now has over 160 people across the U.K., Israel, Japan and Australia.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"IAUPDEE8XY\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/product-manager-hiring-for-startups/\\\">How and when to hire your first product manager</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;How and when to hire your first product manager&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/product-manager-hiring-for-startups/embed/#?secret=mp32Dye4WE#?secret=IAUPDEE8XY\\\" data-secret=\\\"IAUPDEE8XY\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n\",\n                    \"protected\": false\n                },\n                \"excerpt\": {\n                    \"rendered\": \"<p>Last year product analytics and digital adoption platform Pendo pulled in $110 million investment from private equity firm Thoma Bravo, and that was not long after a $150 million tranche of funding.

While some camps have focused on how DAOs can be used as autonomous governance mechanisms for technologies like DeFi protocols, others are using them to make collective decisions for NFT project roadmaps, while some see the structure simply as a new way to add a crypto treasury to their Discord or Telegram group chat.</p><div id=\\\"tc-target-mid-article-2262607\\\" class=\\\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\\\"></div>\\n<p>The reality is that few people have a tight definition for what DAOs are, leaving room for<span style=\\\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\\\"> new organizations to help the crypto-curious make sense of them and help would-be DAO founders make the most of the structure. </span>Founders in the space say that the difficulty in pinning down a catch-all definition for what a &#8220;standard&#8221; DAO should look like only highlights how broad the opportunities are.</p>\\n<p>“At the end of the day, DAOs are a collective technology as opposed to an individual one,” <a href=\\\"https://syndicate.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">Syndicate</a> co-founder Will Papper <a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/hundreds-of-y-combinator-alumni-join-crypto-collective-to-back-web3-startups/\\\">told TechCrunch last week</a>. “DAOs are kind of the next evolution of the corporation because they encode both voice and exit into their foundations.”</p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed breakout\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" data-secret=\\\"GTtANo0tE0\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/crypto-startup-syndicate-looks-to-demystify-daos-with-web3-investment-club-product/\\\">Crypto startup Syndicate looks to demystify DAOs with &#8216;Web3 Investment Clubs&#8217; product</a></p></blockquote>\\n<p><iframe class=\\\"wp-embedded-content\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-scripts\\\" security=\\\"restricted\\\" style=\\\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\\" title=\\\"&#8220;Crypto startup Syndicate looks to demystify DAOs with &#8216;Web3 Investment Clubs&#8217; product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\\\" src=\\\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/crypto-startup-syndicate-looks-to-demystify-daos-with-web3-investment-club-product/embed/#?secret=KpmniWIO8K#?secret=GTtANo0tE0\\\" data-secret=\\\"GTtANo0tE0\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\\n<p>This past week, TechCrunch covered the launch of a16z-backed Syndicate&#8217;s play to help people build out fully compliant crypto &#8220;investment clubs,&#8221; with a network of smart contracts designed to help users build a lasting, stable structure to invest alongside their friends.</p><div class=\\\"piano-inline-promo\\\"></div>\\n<p>Venture-backed startups are looking to help embolden a new generation of DAOs that have varying degrees of blockchain dependencies, enabling founders to use their platforms to navigate regulatory hurdles while relying on smart contracts that these tooling startups have created.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://deepdao.io/organizations\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">DeepDAO</a>, a dedicated DAO analytics firm, is currently following more than 4,100 DAOs.
